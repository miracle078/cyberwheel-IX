# Cyberwheel Report: Simple Explanation for Beginners
## What is Cyberwheel and Why Does It Matter?

### Imagine This Scenario
Think of cybersecurity like a game of cops and robbers, but on computers:
- **Bad guys (hackers)** try to break into computer systems to steal information or cause damage
- **Good guys (cybersecurity defenders)** try to protect those computer systems

**Cyberwheel** is like a video game training simulator where we can practice this cops-and-robbers scenario millions of times to make both sides better at their jobs.

## The Big Picture: What This Research Is About

### The Problem We're Solving
Right now, most cybersecurity systems are like having security guards who only know a few specific tricks. When hackers try something new, these systems often fail. This research is trying to create **smart security systems that can learn and adapt** - like having security guards who get better every day by practicing.

### The Solution: AI That Learns by Playing Games
The researchers created two types of computer programs (called "AI agents"):

1. **Red Agent (The Attacker)**: Like a virtual hacker that tries to break into systems
2. **Blue Agent (The Defender)**: Like a virtual security guard that tries to stop the attacks

These AI programs play against each other millions of times, and each time they play, they get a little bit smarter.

## Key Concepts Explained Simply

### 1. What is "Reinforcement Learning"?
Think of how you learned to ride a bicycle:
- You tried something (like pedaling)
- You got a result (either you stayed up or fell down)
- If you fell, your brain learned "don't do that again"
- If you stayed up, your brain learned "that was good, do more of that"
- You kept practicing until you could ride perfectly

Reinforcement Learning is the same idea, but for computers. The computer tries actions, gets rewards or punishments, and slowly learns what works best.

### 2. What Are "Multi-Agent" Systems?
"Multi-agent" just means "multiple computer programs working at the same time." 
- Like having multiple players in a video game
- In this research, we have attacker programs and defender programs all learning simultaneously
- They influence each other - when one gets better, the others have to adapt

### 3. What is "Adversarial Training"?
This is like sparring in martial arts:
- You practice fighting against someone who's really trying to beat you
- This makes you much better than just practicing alone
- In cybersecurity, we make the attacker AI try really hard to break in, which forces the defender AI to get really good at protection

## The Research Findings (Translated to Plain English)

### Main Discovery 1: SULI Training Method
**What they found**: A new training method called "SULI" works much better than old methods.

**What SULI means**: 
- **Self-play**: The AI practices by playing copies of itself (like playing chess against yourself)
- **Uniform Learning Initialization**: All AI agents start with the same "brain settings"

**Why this matters**: 
- 90% fewer training failures (like 90% fewer times the learning process crashes)
- 30% faster learning (gets smart quicker)
- More stable learning (doesn't forget what it learned)

### Main Discovery 2: Cyber Deception Works Really Well
**What they tested**: 8 different types of "cyber deception" strategies.

**What cyber deception is**: 
Think of it like setting up fake stores to catch shoplifters:
- **Honeypots**: Fake computer systems that look valuable but are actually traps
- **Decoys**: Fake files or servers that attract attackers
- When hackers attack these fake targets, security teams can detect and stop them

**What they found**: Some deception strategies work much better than others, and now we know which ones.

### Main Discovery 3: Size Matters - Scalability Results
**What they tested**: How well does this work on different sized networks?
- Small networks: 15 computers
- Medium networks: 1,000 computers  
- Large networks: 10,000 computers (like a big company)

**What they found**: The system works even on huge networks, but you need more powerful computers to run it.

### Main Discovery 4: Complete Strategy Comparison
**What they did**: Tested every type of defender against every type of attacker (like a tournament bracket).

**What they found**: 
- Some defender strategies are really good against certain attackers but terrible against others
- This helps real companies choose the right defense for their specific threats

## The Math Made Simple

### Episode and Time Steps
```
Episode = One complete "game" of attacker vs defender
Time Step = One "move" in that game
H = Maximum number of moves allowed per game
T = Total number of games played for training
```

Think of it like playing 1,000 games of chess (T=1,000), where each game can last up to 50 moves (H=50).

### States and Actions
```
State = What the AI can "see" at any moment
Action = What the AI can "do" at any moment
```

**For the Red Agent (Attacker)**:
- **State**: Can see what computers are on the network, what software they're running
- **Actions**: Can try to hack specific computers, steal specific files, move between systems

**For the Blue Agent (Defender)**:
- **State**: Can see alerts about suspicious activity, network traffic patterns
- **Actions**: Can block suspicious connections, deploy decoy systems, investigate alerts

### Rewards (How the AI Learns What's Good/Bad)
```
Red Agent Rewards:
+10 points: Successfully hack a real system
-5 points: Get caught by security
-1 point: Waste time on fake systems

Blue Agent Rewards:
+10 points: Successfully trick attacker into fake system
+5 points: Detect and stop real attack
-10 points: Miss a real attack
```

### The Learning Formula
The math formula `J^(r)(π^(r)) = E[∑∑ γ^(h-1) R_(t,h)^(r)]` simply means:
- Take all the rewards the red agent got
- Give more importance to recent rewards (that's what γ does)
- Add them all up
- The goal is to make this total as big as possible

## The Experimental Process (How They Tested Everything)

### Phase 1-7 Training Process
Think of this like training for the Olympics:

**Phase 1-2**: Basic training - Teaching individual AI agents the basics
**Phase 3**: Advanced training - Making agents smarter
**Phase 4**: Competition training - Agents compete against each other
**Phase 5**: Team training - Different agents work together
**Phase 6**: Endurance training - Testing on huge networks
**Phase 7**: Championship - Final testing against everything

### Statistical Validation
Just like in medical research, they didn't just test once:
- Ran the same test multiple times with different random starting points
- Used statistical tests to make sure results weren't just lucky
- Compared against existing methods to prove the new approach is better

## Part 2: Detailed Technical Methodology

### How the "Virtual Computer Network" is Built

#### The Network as a Graph
Think of the computer network like a map of a city:
- **Nodes (Computers)**: Like buildings in the city - each has an address (IP), type (hospital, bank, home), and what's inside (software, files)
- **Edges (Connections)**: Like roads connecting buildings - data can travel along these paths
- **Subnets**: Like neighborhoods - groups of buildings that are close together

**The Math Behind It**: `G = (V, E)`
- `G` = The entire network map
- `V` = All the buildings (computers, routers, subnets)
- `E` = All the roads (network connections)

**Each Computer Looks Like This**:
```
Computer #1:
- IP Address: 192.168.1.5 (like a street address)
- Operating System: Windows 10 (like what type of building it is)
- Services: Web server, database (like what businesses operate inside)
- Vulnerabilities: Outdated software (like broken locks or windows)
- Status: Compromised? (Yes/No - has a burglar gotten inside?)
- Is it Fake?: (Yes/No - is this a decoy building to trap burglars?)
```

### What the Red Agent (Attacker) Can See and Do

#### What the Attacker Knows (State Space)
The attacker's "view" of the world includes:

1. **Current Position**: "I'm currently inside Computer #5"
2. **Knowledge Map**: "I've discovered these 12 computers and 3 network segments"
3. **Attack Phase**: Which stage of the attack I'm in:
   - **Discovery**: "Looking around to see what's here"
   - **Reconnaissance**: "Checking what software is running and finding weaknesses"
   - **Privilege Escalation**: "Breaking into more important systems"
   - **Impact**: "Stealing data or causing damage"
4. **Available Tools**: "I can use these 295 different hacking techniques"

**The Math**: The attacker's brain holds `2×(# of computers) + (# of network segments) + 4 + 295` pieces of information.

#### What the Attacker Can Do (Actions)
The attacker follows a "kill chain" - like a step-by-step burglary plan:

**Phase 1 - Discovery**: 
- Scan the network to see what computers exist
- Like a burglar walking around a neighborhood noting which houses exist

**Phase 2 - Reconnaissance**:
- Check what software is running on each computer
- Look for security vulnerabilities (like checking for unlocked doors)

**Phase 3 - Privilege Escalation**:
- Actually break into computers using found vulnerabilities
- Move from one computer to another (lateral movement)
- Try to get admin access (like finding the master keys)

**Phase 4 - Impact**:
- Steal important data
- Disrupt services
- Install backdoors for future access

**Total Possible Actions**: 12 different attack types × number of computers in network

#### How the Attacker Gets Rewarded
```
+Points for: Successfully hacking a real computer
+Points for: Finding and stealing valuable data
-Points for: Getting caught by security systems
-Points for: Wasting time on fake/decoy systems
```

**The Math**: `Reward = α×(successful attacks) + β×(assets stolen) - λ×(times detected)`

### What the Blue Agent (Defender) Can See and Do

#### What the Defender Knows (State Space)
The defender's "security dashboard" shows:

1. **Current Alerts**: "Right now, I'm seeing suspicious activity on these computers"
2. **Alert History**: "Over time, I've seen attacks on these systems" (sticky memory)
3. **Decoy Status**: "I have fake systems deployed in these locations"
4. **Metadata**: "I have 5 total decoys active right now"

Think of it like a security guard's monitor showing:
- Red blinking lights for current alarms
- Yellow lights for places that had alarms before
- Green lights for fake stores they've set up to catch thieves

**The Math**: The defender's brain holds `3×(# of computers) + 2` pieces of information.

#### What the Defender Can Do (Actions)
The defender has several types of responses:

1. **Deploy Decoys**: Set up fake systems to trick attackers
   - Like setting up a fake bank with cameras inside
   - Different types: fake servers, fake databases, fake user accounts

2. **Remove Decoys**: Take down fake systems when they're not useful

3. **Isolate Systems**: Cut off compromised computers from the network
   - Like locking down a building that's been broken into

4. **Do Nothing**: Sometimes the best action is to wait and watch

**Total Possible Actions**: `2×(# of network segments)×(# of decoy types) + (# of computers) + 1`

#### How the Defender Gets Rewarded
```
+10 Points: Attacker falls for a decoy (huge win!)
-Points: Attacker successfully breaks into real system
-Small cost: Maintaining decoy systems (they're not free)
```

**The Special 10× Multiplier**: The system is designed to **strongly reward** successful deception. If an attacker wastes time on a fake system, the defender gets 10 times more points than the attacker loses. This teaches the AI that deception is very valuable.

## Part 3: The Learning Algorithms Explained

### How the Attacker AI Learns

#### Basic Attacker (Deterministic)
This is like a robber who always follows the same plan:
1. Case the neighborhood (discovery)
2. Find weak points (reconnaissance)  
3. Break in (privilege escalation)
4. Steal stuff (impact)

**Pros**: Predictable, easy to understand
**Cons**: Easy for defenders to learn and counter

#### Smart Attacker (Adaptive)
This attacker learns from the defender's behavior:
- "I notice they always put decoys in the east wing, so I'll focus on the west wing"
- "When I see this type of alert pattern, they usually deploy honeypots next"

**The Math**: `Action Probability = Base Strategy + Adaptation Bonus`
- The adaptation bonus increases chances of actions that counter what the defender typically does

### How the Defender AI Learns (PPO Algorithm)

#### The Basic Learning Process
PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) is like having a security expert who:

1. **Tries different strategies** for a while
2. **Looks back** at what worked and what didn't
3. **Adjusts their approach** to do more of what worked
4. **Repeats** this process millions of times

#### The Three-Phase Learning Cycle

**Phase 1: Experience Collection**
- The AI defender plays the game for many episodes
- Records everything: "In situation X, I did action Y, and got reward Z"
- Like a security guard keeping a detailed logbook

**Phase 2: Learning What Worked**
- Calculates "advantage" - how much better was each action than expected?
- Positive advantage = "That was a good move, do it more often"
- Negative advantage = "That was a bad move, avoid it next time"

**Phase 3: Policy Update**
- Adjusts the AI's "brain" to make better decisions
- But does this **carefully** (that's the "Proximal" part)
- Won't change too dramatically at once (prevents learning from becoming unstable)

#### The Math Behind PPO
```
PPO Loss = min(normal_update, clipped_update)
```

This means: "Make the AI better, but don't change it too much at once"

**Key Parameters**:
- `ε = 0.2`: Maximum change allowed per update (20%)
- `γ = 0.95`: How much future rewards matter vs immediate rewards
- `λ = 0.95`: How much to trust advantage estimates

---

## Part 4: How the System Detects and Responds to Attacks

### Alert Generation System

#### How Alerts Are Created
When an attacker does something suspicious, the system might generate an alert:

```
Alert Components:
- Source Host: "The suspicious activity came from Computer #7"
- Techniques: "They used port scanning and password spraying"
- Timestamp: "This happened at 14:32:15"
- Confidence: "We're 85% sure this is a real attack"
```

#### Detection Probability
Not every attack gets detected immediately:
- **Simple attacks**: 90% chance of detection
- **Sophisticated attacks**: 30% chance of detection
- **Stealth techniques**: 10% chance of detection

**The Math**: `Detection Chance = Product of all technique detection rates`

#### False Alarms
Sometimes the system cries wolf:
- Normal network activity might look suspicious
- Hardware glitches can trigger alerts
- **False Positive Rate**: How often alerts are wrong

**The Math**: `P(false alarm) = 1 - e^(-λ × time)`
- More time passes = higher chance of false alarm

---

## Part 5: How We Measure Success

### Security Effectiveness Metrics

#### 1. Deception Rate
**Question**: "How often do attackers fall for our traps?"

**Formula**: `(Attacks on fake systems) ÷ (Total attacks)`

**Example**: If attackers make 100 attempts and 30 of them target decoys, deception rate = 30%

#### 2. Asset Protection Rate  
**Question**: "How much of our important stuff is still safe?"

**Formula**: `(Safe computers) ÷ (Total real computers)`

**Example**: If we have 50 real computers and 45 are still secure, protection rate = 90%

#### 3. Detection Speed
**Question**: "How fast do we notice when an attack starts?"

**Formula**: `Average time between attack start and first alert`

**Example**: If attacks start at minute 5 and we detect them at minute 8 on average, detection latency = 3 minutes

### Operational Efficiency Metrics

#### 1. Resource Efficiency
**Question**: "Are we getting good value from our security investments?"

**Formula**: `(Successful deceptions) ÷ (Cost of all decoys and isolation actions)`

**Example**: If our 10 decoys catch 5 attackers, and each decoy costs 1 unit, efficiency = 5/10 = 0.5

#### 2. False Positive Rate
**Question**: "How often are our alarms wrong?"

**Formula**: `(False alarms) ÷ (Total alarms)`

**Example**: If we have 20 alarms and 3 are false, false positive rate = 15%

### Learning Progress Metrics

#### 1. Total Reward
This is the AI's "report card" - higher scores mean better performance.

**For Defenders**: Higher rewards = better protection + more successful deceptions
**For Attackers**: Higher rewards = more successful attacks

#### 2. Adaptation Index
**Question**: "How much better did the AI get through training?"

**Formula**: `(Performance in final episodes) ÷ (Performance in first episodes)`

**Example**: If the AI scored 100 points at the start and 300 points at the end, adaptation index = 3.0 (it got 3× better)

#### 3. Mean Time to Compromise (MTTC)
**Question**: "How long does it take attackers to break into critical systems?"

**For Defenders**: Longer MTTC = better (attackers take longer to succeed)
**For Attackers**: Shorter MTTC = better (they succeed faster)

- **Result**: 5 expertly trained attacker AIs using real cyber attack methods

### Phase 4: The Tournament (Cross-Evaluation Matrix)
**What happens**: Every defender fights every attacker
**Like**: Olympic tournament where every competitor faces every other competitor

**The Math**: 8 defenders × 5 attackers = 40 unique matchups
**Each matchup**: 50+ rounds to ensure fair results

**Key Questions Answered**:
- Which defender works best against which attacker?
- Are deception strategies better than detection strategies?
- How do resource costs affect performance?
- What defensive strategy should a company choose?

### Phase 5: Advanced Team Training (SULI Co-Evolution)
**What happens**: Train attackers and defenders together simultaneously
**Like**: Training boxers by having them spar against each other as they both improve

**SULI Method Explained**:
- **Self-play**: AI practices against copies of itself
- **Uniform Initialization**: All AI start with same "brain settings"
- **Co-evolution**: Attacker and defender improve together

**Key Discovery**: This method is **much better** than training them separately:
- 90% fewer training crashes
- 30% faster learning
- More stable long-term performance

**Variants Tested**:
- Baseline SULI
- Large-scale SULI (big networks)
- Medium-scale SULI (balanced approach)
- Small-scale SULI (intensive analysis)

### Phase 6: Stress Testing (Scalability Analysis)

- **1K Test**: 1,000 computers (medium business)
- **5K Test**: 5,000 computers (large corporation) 
- **10K Test**: 10,000 computers (enterprise/government)

**What They Measured**:
- How long training takes
- How much computer power needed
- How much memory required
- Does performance stay good as size increases?

**Key Finding**: The system works even on huge networks, but you need more powerful computers to run it.

### Phase 7: Scientific Validation (Making Sure Results Are Real)
**What happens**: Rigorous testing to prove results aren't just lucky
**Like**: Testing a new medicine multiple times with different patient groups

**Statistical Rigor**:
- **Multiple Seeds**: Run same test 5 times with different random starting points (seeds: 1, 42, 123, 456, 789)
- **Confidence Intervals**: Calculate how sure we are about results (95% confidence)
- **Significance Testing**: Mathematical proof results aren't random chance

**Reproducibility Checks**:
- Same results on different computers
- Complete documentation of all settings
- Other researchers can recreate the experiments

## Part 9: The Math and Technical Details Simplified

### Core Mathematical Concepts

#### 1. Reward Functions (How AI Learns Right from Wrong)
**For Defenders (Blue Agent)**:
```
Total Reward = Deception Success + Asset Protection - Costs

Where:
- Deception Success = 10 × (attacks caught by decoys)
- Asset Protection = -(attacks on real systems)  
- Costs = (cost to maintain decoys)
```

**Why the 10× multiplier?** Makes the AI **really** want to use deception effectively.

**For Attackers (Red Agent)**:
```
Total Reward = Successful Attacks + Data Stolen - Detection Penalties

Where:
- Successful Attacks = +points for each system compromised
- Data Stolen = +points for each valuable file taken  
- Detection Penalties = -points for getting caught
```

#### 2. State Spaces (What the AI Can "See")
**Defender's View**:
- Current alerts from all computers
- History of previous alerts
- Where decoy systems are deployed
- Network topology and connections

**Attacker's View**:
- Current position in network
- Discovered network structure
- Available hacking techniques
- Current phase of attack (discovery/attack/data theft)

#### 3. Action Spaces (What the AI Can "Do")
**Defender Actions**:
- Deploy decoys on network segments
- Remove decoys when not useful
- Isolate compromised computers
- Do nothing (sometimes best option)

**Attacker Actions**:
- Scan for new computers
- Probe for vulnerabilities
- Exploit found weaknesses
- Move between compromised systems
- Steal data or cause damage

#### 4. Learning Algorithm (PPO Simplified)
**The Three-Step Learning Cycle**:

1. **Experience Collection**: "Try different strategies and see what happens"
2. **Advantage Calculation**: "Figure out which actions were better than expected"
3. **Policy Update**: "Adjust the AI's brain to do more good actions and fewer bad ones"

**Key Insight**: The "Proximal" part means "don't change too much at once" - prevents the AI from forgetting everything it learned.

### Network Representation

#### Graph Theory Made Simple
**The Network as a Map**:
- **Nodes (V)**: All the computers, routers, and network segments
- **Edges (E)**: All the connections between them
- **Mathematical notation**: G = (V, E) just means "a network map with places and connections"

**Each Computer's Profile**:
```
Computer Information:
- IP Address: 192.168.1.100 (like a street address)
- Operating System: Windows/Linux/Mac (like house type)
- Services: Web server, database, email (like businesses inside)
- Vulnerabilities: Known security holes (like broken locks)
- Status: Compromised? (Yes/No)
- Type: Real or Decoy? (Real building vs fake storefront)
```

### Detection and Alert System

#### How Alerts Work
**Alert Generation Process**:
1. Attacker does something suspicious
2. System calculates: "How likely are we to notice this?"
3. If detection probability > random number, generate alert
4. Alert includes: source, technique used, confidence level

**False Alarms**:
- Sometimes normal activity looks suspicious
- Rate of false alarms follows mathematical pattern
- More time passing = higher chance of false alarm

**Detection Probability Formula**:
```
Detection Chance = (Technique 1 Detection) × (Technique 2 Detection) × ...
```
If attacker uses multiple techniques, chance of detecting at least one is higher.
