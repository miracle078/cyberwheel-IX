# Thesis Project Summary: RL Experiments in Cyber Defense

## Project Overview
**Title**: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Defense: Experimental Analysis and Training Methodology Validation Using Cyberwheel

**Research Focus**: Conducting novel experimental research to advance RL training methodologies for cybersecurity applications using the established Cyberwheel framework.

## Key Clarification
- **Building ON** the Cyberwheel environment (existing framework developed by prior researchers)
- **NOT building** the environment itself - focusing on experimental contributions
- **Using** sophisticated cybersecurity simulation as foundation for RL research

## Research Questions Being Addressed

1. **Training Methodology Effectiveness**: How effective are different adversarial training approaches for cybersecurity RL, particularly SULI vs. traditional methods?

2. **Deception Strategy Performance**: What are the quantitative performance characteristics of different cyber deception strategies when systematically evaluated?

3. **Cross-Strategy Interactions**: How do different defensive strategies perform against various attack types in controlled experimental settings?

4. **Scalability Characteristics**: How do RL approaches scale with network size and what are the performance trade-offs?
