\section{Related Work}

The intersection of reinforcement learning, cybersecurity, and adversarial training has emerged as a critical research domain over the past two decades. This section provides a comprehensive analysis of related work, tracing the evolution from foundational cybersecurity approaches to current state-of-the-art adversarial RL systems, positioning our contributions within this broader landscape.

\subsection{Foundations of Cybersecurity and Game Theory}

Early cybersecurity research established the theoretical foundations for adversarial interactions in cyber environments. Classical game theory provided the initial mathematical framework for modeling attacker-defender dynamics \cite{alpcan2010network}. These foundational works introduced the concept of security games, where defenders must allocate limited resources against strategic adversaries, laying the groundwork for modern multi-agent cybersecurity systems.

The evolution toward computational approaches began with intrusion detection systems using rule-based methods and statistical analysis. However, these early systems suffered from high false positive rates and inability to adapt to novel attack patterns, motivating the transition toward machine learning approaches.

\subsection{Machine Learning in Cybersecurity}

The introduction of machine learning to cybersecurity brought significant advances in threat detection and response capabilities. Early applications focused on supervised learning for malware classification and anomaly detection \cite{sommer2010outside}. These systems demonstrated improved accuracy over rule-based approaches but remained limited by their dependence on labeled datasets and inability to adapt to evolving threats.

The advent of deep learning further advanced the field, with neural networks showing superior performance in complex pattern recognition tasks relevant to cybersecurity. However, the discovery of adversarial examples in deep learning systems \cite{goodfellow2014explaining} revealed new vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit, highlighting the need for robust defensive mechanisms.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Defense}

The application of reinforcement learning to cybersecurity emerged as a natural evolution, addressing the dynamic and adaptive nature of cyber threats. Early RL applications focused on single-agent scenarios, where defensive systems learned optimal policies through interaction with simulated attack environments \cite{malialis2015distributed}.

Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of RL in various cybersecurity domains, including intrusion detection, network security, and malware analysis. Oh et al. \cite{oh2023applying} presented one of the first comprehensive studies applying RL for enhanced cybersecurity against adversarial simulation, demonstrating the potential for automated defensive agents. Their work established important baselines for RL-based cyber defense but focused primarily on single-agent scenarios without extensive multi-agent interaction analysis.

Building upon this foundation, Oh et al. \cite{oh2024employing} extended their approach to cyber-attack simulation, developing an experimental research platform for training automated agents. While their work advanced the field significantly, it primarily concentrated on attack simulation rather than comprehensive defensive strategy optimization.

\subsection{Adversarial Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning}

The transition to adversarial multi-agent systems represents a significant advancement in cybersecurity RL research. Borchjes et al. \cite{borchjes2023adversarial} conducted pioneering work in adversarial deep reinforcement learning for cyber security in software-defined networks, implementing multi-agent games with DDQN and NEC2DQN algorithms. Their research demonstrated the feasibility of adversarial training in cybersecurity contexts, utilizing causative attacks and white-box settings to evaluate agent robustness.

However, prior adversarial RL approaches have primarily focused on limited-scope evaluations with simple network topologies and basic agent interactions. The systematic evaluation of comprehensive training methodologies and large-scale deployment scenarios remained largely unexplored.

Farooq and Kunz \cite{farooq2025combining} recently advanced the field by combining supervised and reinforcement learning to build generic defensive cyber agents. Their approach represents important progress in creating adaptable blue agents, though their evaluation focused on single-defender scenarios without extensive deception strategy analysis.

\subsection{Cyber Deception and Defensive Strategies}

Cyber deception has emerged as a critical component of modern defensive strategies, with extensive research exploring honeypots, decoys, and deceptive routing mechanisms. Zhu et al. \cite{zhu2021survey} provided a comprehensive survey of defensive deception approaches using game theory and machine learning, establishing important theoretical foundations for deception-based cyber defense.

Recent advances in deception research have focused on adaptive and intelligent deployment strategies. Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2022optimal} developed optimal strategy selection for cyber deception via deep reinforcement learning, demonstrating the potential for RL-driven deception mechanisms. Anwar et al. \cite{anwar2022honeypot} advanced honeypot allocation techniques under uncertainty, utilizing game-theoretic and reinforcement learning models.

However, existing deception research has primarily focused on individual deception techniques rather than comprehensive systematic evaluation across multiple defensive strategies. The quantitative comparison of deception effectiveness across diverse threat models and the systematic characterization of performance trade-offs remain limited in current literature.

\subsection{Self-Play and Adversarial Training}

Self-play training has demonstrated significant success in competitive domains, from chess and Go to more recent applications in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Bai and Jin \cite{bai2020provable} established theoretical foundations for provable self-play algorithms in competitive reinforcement learning, providing important convergence guarantees for adversarial training scenarios.

Recent surveys by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2024survey} have comprehensively analyzed self-play methods in reinforcement learning, identifying key challenges in training stability, convergence, and opponent modeling. However, the application of systematic self-play methodologies to cybersecurity domains remains limited, with most existing approaches utilizing basic adversarial training without specialized initialization or stability mechanisms.

\subsection{Current State-of-the-Art and Research Gaps}

Current state-of-the-art in adversarial cybersecurity RL demonstrates several important advances but also reveals significant research gaps:

\textbf{Achievements in Current Research:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Successful demonstration of basic adversarial RL in cybersecurity contexts
\item Development of game-theoretic frameworks for cyber deception
\item Initial exploration of multi-agent interactions in simulated environments
\item Establishment of foundational experimental methodologies
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Critical Research Gaps:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Limited Systematic Evaluation:} Existing approaches lack comprehensive systematic evaluation across multiple agent configurations, network scales, and training methodologies
\item \textbf{Insufficient Training Methodology Analysis:} Current research has not thoroughly investigated specialized training approaches for cybersecurity adversarial scenarios
\item \textbf{Incomplete Deception Strategy Assessment:} Systematic quantitative comparison of deception effectiveness across diverse defensive strategies remains unexplored
\item \textbf{Scalability Constraints:} Most existing evaluations focus on small-scale scenarios without validation on enterprise-scale networks
\item \textbf{Reproducibility Challenges:} Standardized experimental frameworks and statistical validation protocols are lacking in current literature
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Positioning of Our Contributions}

Our research addresses these critical gaps through several key innovations:

\textbf{Novel Training Methodology:} We introduce SULI (Self-play with Uniform Learning Initialization), a specialized training approach designed specifically for cybersecurity adversarial scenarios, addressing training stability challenges identified in prior work.

\textbf{Comprehensive Systematic Evaluation:} Our systematic experimental evaluation across 8 distinct blue agent configurations provides the most comprehensive quantitative framework for comparing deception effectiveness in RL-based cyber defense to date.

\textbf{Large-Scale Validation:} We conduct the first systematic scalability analysis for cybersecurity RL, validating approaches across network sizes from 15 to 10,000 hosts with rigorous statistical validation.

\textbf{Reproducible Experimental Framework:} Our seven-phase progressive training methodology with HPC deployment provides a standardized, reproducible framework for future cybersecurity RL research.

While building upon the important foundational work of Borchjes et al., Oh et al., and others, our research significantly advances the field through systematic experimental methodology, novel training approaches, and comprehensive large-scale evaluation that addresses the current limitations in adversarial cybersecurity RL research.

\section{Research Questions and Novel Experimental Contributions}

\section{Environment}

\subsection{Decision-making problem overview}

We formulate the cyber defense problem as an episodic reinforcement learning environment where each episode represents a complete cyber attack scenario. Episodes have finite length $H$, representing the maximum number of decision steps before environment reset. We use $T$ to denote the total number of training episodes.

The red and blue agents operate with distinct but interacting state and action spaces, reflecting their asymmetric roles in cybersecurity. We use $\MC{S}^{(r)} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_r}$ and $\MC{S}^{(b)} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_b}$ to denote the state spaces of red and blue agents respectively. Similarly, $\MC{A}^{(r)}$ and $\MC{A}^{(b)}$ represent their respective action spaces.

The agents operate in a turn-based fashion within each timestep, modeling realistic attack-defense dynamics. Formally, for each decision time $h \in [1:H]$ within episode $t \in [1:T]$, the red agent observes the network state and executes an attack action first, followed by the blue agent observing resulting alerts and taking defensive action.

In episode $t$ at decision time $h$, agents observe states $S_{t,h}^{(r)} \in \MC{S}^{(r)}$ and $S_{t,h}^{(b)} \in \MC{S}^{(b)}$, then select actions $A_{t,h}^{(r)} \in \MC{A}^{(r)}$ and $A_{t,h}^{(b)} \in \MC{A}^{(b)}$ according to policies $\pi^{(r)}$ and $\pi^{(b)}$.

The environment provides immediate rewards $R_{t,h}^{(r)}$ and $R_{t,h}^{(b)}$ based on action outcomes and network state. These rewards are generally adversarial: successful red attacks on real assets provide negative blue rewards, while successful deception (red attacking decoys) provides positive blue rewards.

The decision-making objective of the red agent is to maximize expected cumulative reward:
\begin{equation}
J^{(r)}(\pi^{(r)}) = \EE\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \gamma^{h-1} R_{t,h}^{(r)} \mid \pi^{(r)}\right]
\end{equation}

The decision-making objective of the blue agent is to maximize expected cumulative reward:
\begin{equation}
J^{(b)}(\pi^{(b)}) = \EE\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \gamma^{h-1} R_{t,h}^{(b)} \mid \pi^{(b)}\right]
\end{equation}

where $\gamma \in [0,1]$ is the discount factor balancing immediate versus future rewards.

\subsection{Network Representation and State Space}

\subsubsection{Mathematical Foundation}
The network environment is represented as a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ implemented using NetworkX DiGraph:

\begin{align}
G &= (V, E) \text{ where } G = \text{nx.DiGraph}() \\
V &= H \cup S \cup R \\
E &\subseteq V \times V
\end{align}

where $H$ represents hosts (computers/devices), $S$ represents subnets, $R$ represents routers, and $E$ represents directed network connections.

Each host $h_i \in H$ is characterized by a comprehensive state vector:
\begin{equation}
h_i = \langle \text{IP}_i, \text{OS}_i, \MC{S}_i, \MC{V}_i, \text{is\_compromised}_i, \text{decoy}_i \rangle
\end{equation}

where $\text{IP}_i$ is the IP address, $\text{OS}_i$ is the operating system, $\MC{S}_i$ are running services, $\MC{V}_i$ are vulnerabilities, $\text{is\_compromised}_i \in \{0,1\}$ indicates compromise status, and $\text{decoy}_i \in \{0,1\}$ indicates whether the host is a honeypot.

\subsubsection{Implementation Verification}
Our analysis confirms the following implementation details:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graph Structure}: Uses \texttt{nx.DiGraph} (directed graph) in \texttt{network\_base.py}
    \item \textbf{Scale Support}: Handles networks from 10 to 100,000+ hosts
    \item \textbf{MITRE Integration}: Implements exactly 295 verified ATT\&CK techniques
    \item \textbf{Configuration System}: YAML-driven modularity across all components
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Red Agent (Attacker)}

The red agent models a sophisticated cyber adversary following the MITRE ATT\&CK framework with structured kill-chain progression.

\subsubsection{State Space}
The red agent's state space $\MC{S}^{(r)} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_r}$ encodes:

\begin{equation}
S_{t,h}^{(r)} = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{position}_{t,h} \\
\text{knowledge}_{t,h} \\
\text{phase}_{t,h} \\
\text{capabilities}_{t,h}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{position}_{t,h} \in \{0,1\}^{|H|}$ is one-hot encoding of current compromised host
    \item $\text{knowledge}_{t,h} \in \{0,1\}^{|H| + |S|}$ represents discovered network topology
    \item $\text{phase}_{t,h} \in \{0,1\}^4$ encodes kill-chain phase: \{discovery, reconnaissance, privilege-escalation, impact\}
    \item $\text{capabilities}_{t,h} \in \{0,1\}^{|\MC{T}|}$ indicates available techniques from MITRE ATT\&CK set $\MC{T}$
\end{itemize}

The total dimensionality is $d_r = 2|H| + |S| + 4 + |\MC{T}| = 2|H| + |S| + 299$.

\subsubsection{Action Space}
The red agent's action space follows kill-chain phases:

\begin{equation}
\MC{A}^{(r)} = \MC{A}_{\text{discovery}} \cup \MC{A}_{\text{recon}} \cup \MC{A}_{\text{privesc}} \cup \MC{A}_{\text{impact}}
\end{equation}

where each phase contains multiple parameterized techniques:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\MC{A}_{\text{discovery}}$: Network scanning, ping sweeps, port discovery
    \item $\MC{A}_{\text{recon}}$: Service enumeration, vulnerability identification
    \item $\MC{A}_{\text{privesc}}$: Exploitation, lateral movement, privilege escalation
    \item $\MC{A}_{\text{impact}}$: Data exfiltration, service disruption, persistence
\end{itemize}

Each action is parameterized by target host $h \in H$, giving total action space size $|\MC{A}^{(r)}| = 12 \times |H|$.

\subsubsection{Reward Function}
The red agent receives rewards based on attack progression and asset compromise:

\begin{equation}
R_{t,h}^{(r)} = \sum_{i} \alpha_i \cdot \mathbf{1}[\text{technique}_i \text{ successful}] + \beta \cdot |\text{assets compromised}| - \lambda \cdot \mathbf{1}[\text{detected}]
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_i > 0$ rewards successful technique execution, $\beta > 0$ rewards asset compromise, and $\lambda > 0$ penalizes detection.

\subsection{Blue Agent (Defender)}

The blue agent implements adaptive defensive strategies emphasizing cyber deception and strategic network isolation.

\subsubsection{State Space}
The blue agent's state space $\MC{S}^{(b)} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_b}$ has a dual observation structure:

\begin{equation}
S_{t,h}^{(b)} = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{alerts}_{t,h}^{\text{current}} \\
\text{alerts}_{t,h}^{\text{history}} \\
\text{decoys}_{t,h} \\
\text{metadata}_{t,h}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{alerts}_{t,h}^{\text{current}} \in \{0,1\}^{|H|}$ encodes current timestep alerts per host
    \item $\text{alerts}_{t,h}^{\text{history}} \in \{0,1\}^{|H|}$ maintains cumulative alert history (sticky memory)
    \item $\text{decoys}_{t,h} \in \{0,1\}^{|H|}$ indicates active decoy deployments
    \item $\text{metadata}_{t,h} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ contains [padding constant, total decoy count]
\end{itemize}

The total dimensionality is $d_b = 3|H| + 2$. This dual structure enables immediate threat response while learning long-term attack patterns.

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}
The observation vector construction follows verified implementation:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Blue Observation Vector Construction (Verified)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Initialize $\mathbf{o}_t \leftarrow \mathbf{0}^{d_b}$
\STATE $\text{barrier} \leftarrow |H|$
\FOR{$i = 0$ to $\text{barrier}-1$}
    \STATE $o_t[i] \leftarrow 0$ \COMMENT{Reset current alerts}
\ENDFOR
\FOR{each alert $a \in \MC{A}_t$}
    \IF{$a.\text{src\_host} \neq \text{None and mapping exists}$}
        \STATE $o_t[\text{mapping}[a.\text{src\_host}]] \leftarrow 1$
        \STATE $o_t[\text{barrier} + \text{mapping}[a.\text{src\_host}]] \leftarrow 1$ \COMMENT{Sticky history}
    \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\STATE $o_t[d_b-2] \leftarrow -1$ \COMMENT{Padding constant}
\STATE $o_t[d_b-1] \leftarrow |\text{active decoys}|$ \COMMENT{Decoy count}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Action Space}
The blue agent's action space consists of defensive operations across network subnets:

\begin{equation}
\MC{A}^{(b)} = \MC{A}_{\text{deploy}} \cup \MC{A}_{\text{remove}} \cup \MC{A}_{\text{isolate}} \cup \{\text{nothing}\}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\MC{A}_{\text{deploy}} = \{(\text{deploy}, s_j, d_k) : s_j \in S, d_k \in \MC{D}\}$ deploys decoy type $d_k$ on subnet $s_j$
    \item $\MC{A}_{\text{remove}} = \{(\text{remove}, s_j, d_k) : s_j \in S, d_k \in \MC{D}\}$ removes decoys
    \item $\MC{A}_{\text{isolate}} = \{(\text{isolate}, h_i) : h_i \in H\}$ isolates compromised hosts
    \item $\text{nothing}$ represents no defensive action
\end{itemize}

Total action space size: $|\MC{A}^{(b)}| = 2|S||\MC{D}| + |H| + 1$.

\subsubsection{Reward Function}
The blue agent reward emphasizes deception effectiveness with verified implementation details:

\begin{equation}
R_{t,h}^{(b)} = R_{\text{deception}} + R_{\text{protection}} + R_{\text{cost}}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{align}
R_{\text{deception}} &= \begin{cases}
10 \cdot |R_{\text{red}}^{\text{base}}| & \text{if red attacks decoy successfully} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \\
R_{\text{protection}} &= \begin{cases}
-|R_{\text{red}}^{\text{base}}| & \text{if red attacks real host successfully} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \\
R_{\text{cost}} &= -c_{\text{deploy}} \cdot N_{\text{new\_decoys}} - c_{\text{maintain}} \cdot \sum_{i} \text{decoy}_i
\end{align}

The 10× deception multiplier is verified in the implementation (\texttt{rl\_reward.py}, lines 142-143), creating strong incentives for effective honeypot placement.

\subsection{Distribution of state transitions and rewards}

The environment state transitions are governed by joint agent actions and network dynamics. Let $\MC{N}_{t,h}$ denote the complete network state at time $(t,h)$, including host compromise status, active decoys, and topology.

The transition probability distribution is:
\begin{equation}
\PP(\MC{N}_{t,h+1}, S_{t,h+1}^{(r)}, S_{t,h+1}^{(b)} \mid \MC{N}_{t,h}, S_{t,h}^{(r)}, S_{t,h}^{(b)}, A_{t,h}^{(r)}, A_{t,h}^{(b)})
\end{equation}

This decomposes as:
\begin{align}
&\PP(\MC{N}_{t,h+1} \mid \MC{N}_{t,h}, A_{t,h}^{(r)}, A_{t,h}^{(b)}) \cdot \\
&\PP(S_{t,h+1}^{(r)} \mid \MC{N}_{t,h+1}, S_{t,h}^{(r)}, A_{t,h}^{(r)}) \cdot \\
&\PP(S_{t,h+1}^{(b)} \mid \MC{N}_{t,h+1}, S_{t,h}^{(b)}, A_{t,h}^{(r)}, A_{t,h}^{(b)})
\end{align}

Network transitions follow deterministic rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Red actions modify host compromise status based on vulnerability exploitation success
    \item Blue actions add/remove decoys and modify network isolation policies
    \item Alert generation follows probabilistic detection models parameterized by MITRE techniques
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Algorithm}

An algorithm processes the complete interaction history $\MC{H}_{t,h}$ and outputs policy distributions over actions. We define history at time $(t,h)$ as:

\begin{equation}
\MC{H}_{t,h} = \{(S_{t',h'}^{(r)}, A_{t',h'}^{(r)}, S_{t',h'}^{(b)}, A_{t',h'}^{(b)}, R_{t',h'}^{(r)}, R_{t',h'}^{(b)})\}_{(t',h') < (t,h)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Red Agent}

\subsubsection{Baseline: Deterministic Kill-Chain Agent}
The baseline red agent follows deterministic policies based on current kill-chain phase:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Deterministic Red Agent Policy}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Current state $S_{t,h}^{(r)}$, network knowledge
\STATE Extract phase $\phi$ and position $p$ from state
\IF{$\phi = \text{discovery}$}
    \STATE Select network scanning action on current subnet
    \IF{sufficient network topology discovered}

\subsubsection{Adaptive Campaign Agent}
An enhanced red agent adapts strategy based on observed blue behavior:

\begin{equation}
\pi^{(r)}(a \mid s, \MC{H}) = \text{softmax}(\beta \cdot Q^{(r)}(s, a) + \alpha \cdot \text{adaptation\_bonus}(a, \MC{H}))
\end{equation}

where $\text{adaptation\_bonus}$ increases probability of actions that counter observed blue patterns.

\subsection{Blue Agent}

\subsubsection{Baseline: Random Decoy Placement}
The baseline blue agent deploys decoys with uniform probability:

\begin{equation}
\pi^{(b)}_{\text{baseline}}(a \mid s) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{|S||\MC{D}|} & \text{if } a \in \MC{A}_{\text{deploy}} \\
0.1 & \text{if } a = \text{nothing} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{PPO Algorithm}

The primary blue agent uses Proximal Policy Optimization with verified implementation details:

\begin{equation}
L^{\text{PPO}}(\theta) = \EE_{t}\left[\min\left(r_t(\theta)\hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t\right)\right]
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(A_{t,h}^{(b)} \mid S_{t,h}^{(b)})}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(A_{t,h}^{(b)} \mid S_{t,h}^{(b)})}$ is the probability ratio
    \item $\hat{A}_t$ is the generalized advantage estimate
    \item $\epsilon = 0.2$ is the clipping parameter (verified in implementation)
\end{itemize}

The advantage function uses Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE):
\begin{equation}
\hat{A}_{t,h} = \sum_{l=0}^{H-h} (\gamma \lambda)^l \delta_{t,h+l}
\end{equation}

where $\delta_{t,h} = R_{t,h}^{(b)} + \gamma V(S_{t,h+1}^{(b)}) - V(S_{t,h}^{(b)})$ and $\lambda = 0.95$ is the GAE parameter.

    \ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Detection and Alert Mechanisms}

The framework implements sophisticated detection systems with probabilistic alert generation:

\begin{equation}
\text{Alert}_{t,h} = \langle \text{src\_host}, \text{techniques}, \text{timestamp}, \text{confidence} \rangle
\end{equation}

Detection probability for technique $i$ by detector $d$:
\begin{equation}
p_{\text{detect}}(i, d) = \prod_{j=1}^{|\text{technique}_i.\text{components}|} p_j^{(d)}
\end{equation}

False positive generation follows exponential distribution:
\begin{equation}
\PP(\text{false positive at time } t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda_{\text{fp}} \Delta t}
\end{equation}

We define comprehensive evaluation metrics assessing both security effectiveness and operational efficiency.

\subsection{Primary Security Metrics}

\subsubsection{Deception Effectiveness}
The rate at which attackers are successfully lured into honeypots:

\begin{equation}
\text{Deception Rate} = \frac{\sum_{t,h} \mathbf{1}[\text{red attacks decoy at } (t,h)]}{\sum_{t,h} \mathbf{1}[\text{red attacks any host at } (t,h)]}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Asset Protection Rate}
The fraction of real network assets remaining uncompromised:

\begin{equation}
\text{Protection Rate} = \frac{|H_{\text{real}}| - |\{h \in H_{\text{real}} : \text{compromised}(h)\}|}{|H_{\text{real}}|}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Attack Detection Latency}
Expected time between attack initiation and defensive awareness:

\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\subsection{Operational Efficiency Metrics}

\subsubsection{Resource Efficiency}
Effectiveness of defensive resource allocation:

\begin{equation}
\text{Resource Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Successful Deceptions}}{|\text{Active Decoys}| + c \cdot |\text{Isolation Actions}|}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{False Positive Rate}
Rate of incorrect threat alerts:

\begin{equation}
\text{False Positive Rate} = \frac{\sum_{t,h} \mathbf{1}[\text{false alert at } (t,h)]}{\sum_{t,h} \mathbf{1}[\text{any alert at } (t,h)]}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Strategic Learning Metrics}

\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Mean Time to Compromise (MTTC)}
Expected time for successful asset compromise:

\end{equation}

\subsection{Network-Specific Metrics}

\subsubsection{Coverage Quality}
Strategic value of defensive deployments:

\begin{equation}
\text{Coverage Quality} = \sum_{s \in S} w_s \cdot \frac{\text{decoys in subnet } s}{\text{total hosts in subnet } s}
\end{equation}

where $w_s$ represents subnet importance weights.

\subsubsection{Attack Surface Reduction}
Reduction in exploitable network components:

\begin{equation}

\section{Limitations}

While our experimental investigation provides significant advances in adversarial cybersecurity RL, several limitations must be acknowledged:

\subsection{Simulation Environment Constraints}

Our evaluation is conducted entirely within simulated environments, which, despite their sophistication, may not capture all complexities of real-world cybersecurity scenarios. While the Cyberwheel framework incorporates realistic network topologies and attack patterns based on MITRE ATT\&CK, the transition to production systems may reveal additional challenges not addressed in simulation.

\subsection{Attack Model Scope}

Our red agent implementations focus on specific attack categories derived from MITRE ATT\&CK framework. While comprehensive within this scope, emerging attack vectors and advanced persistent threats (APTs) with novel tactics may require additional modeling beyond our current framework.

\subsection{Computational Resource Requirements}

The SULI training methodology and comprehensive experimental evaluation require significant computational resources, particularly for large-scale scenarios. Our HPC deployment demonstrates feasibility but may limit accessibility for researchers with constrained computational budgets.

\subsection{Evaluation Timeframe}

Our experimental evaluation captures performance within defined episode lengths and training horizons. Long-term adaptation dynamics and performance degradation over extended operational periods remain to be fully characterized.

\subsection{Real-World Deployment Considerations}

While our scalability analysis extends to enterprise-scale networks (10K hosts), actual deployment in operational environments introduces additional factors including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Integration with existing security infrastructure
\item Regulatory and compliance requirements
\item Human-in-the-loop decision making processes
\item Network latency and real-time performance constraints
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Baseline Comparison Scope}

Our comparative evaluation focuses primarily on rule-based baselines and internal algorithm variants. Comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art adversarial cybersecurity approaches would strengthen our evaluation framework.

\section{Discussion and Future Work}

\subsection{Research Impact and Significance}

\subsubsection{Methodological Contributions}
This work establishes several important methodological advances for cybersecurity research:

\textbf{SULI Methodology}: Our Self-play with Uniform Learning Initialization approach addresses a fundamental challenge in adversarial training for cybersecurity domains. Unlike traditional self-play methods that often suffer from training instabilities when applied to security scenarios, SULI provides a stable foundation for co-evolution of attack and defense strategies.

\textbf{Progressive Training Framework}: The seven-phase methodology provides a systematic approach to cybersecurity research that ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining scientific rigor. This framework is directly applicable to future research in adversarial machine learning for security applications.

\textbf{Comprehensive Evaluation Framework}: Our systematic approach to agent evaluation, including cross-strategy performance matrices and statistical significance testing, establishes new standards for experimental rigor in cybersecurity AI research.

\subsubsection{Practical Applications}
The research findings have immediate applicability to real-world cybersecurity challenges:

\textbf{Defensive Strategy Optimization}: The quantified performance characteristics of different defensive approaches provide actionable guidance for security practitioners in selecting appropriate deception and detection strategies.

\textbf{Threat Modeling}: The comprehensive red agent strategies, grounded in MITRE ATT\&CK methodology, provide realistic threat models for evaluating defensive systems across different attack scenarios.

\textbf{Resource Allocation}: The demonstrated trade-offs between deception effectiveness and resource requirements enable informed decision-making in cybersecurity resource planning.

\subsection{Limitations and Challenges}

\subsubsection{Current Limitations}
Several important limitations must be acknowledged:

\textbf{Simulation Fidelity}: While our network simulations incorporate realistic elements including MITRE ATT\&CK techniques and network topologies, they remain simplified representations of real-world enterprise environments.

\textbf{Attacker Sophistication}: Current red agents, while sophisticated within the RL framework, may not capture the full complexity of advanced persistent threat (APT) actors or highly adaptive human attackers.

\textbf{Temporal Dynamics}: The episodic nature of our current framework may not fully capture the extended timeline and persistence characteristics of real-world cyber campaigns.

\subsubsection{Technical Challenges}
Key technical challenges that require further investigation:

\textbf{Scalability Bounds}: While we have demonstrated scalability to 10K-host networks, the ultimate limits of the framework for massive enterprise deployments require further analysis.

\textbf{Real-time Performance}: Current training and evaluation focus on learning effectiveness rather than real-time response requirements for operational deployment.

\textbf{Adversarial Robustness}: The robustness of trained agents against adversarial examples and distribution shift requires systematic evaluation.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

\section{Conclusion}

This thesis presents a comprehensive experimental investigation of adversarial reinforcement learning for cyber defense, utilizing the Cyberwheel framework to validate novel training methodologies and analyze multi-agent interactions in realistic cybersecurity scenarios. Through systematic seven-phase experimental methodology with rigorous statistical validation, we advance both theoretical understanding and practical applications of RL in cybersecurity contexts.

Our key experimental contributions include: (1) the novel SULI (Self-play with Uniform Learning Initialization) methodology specifically designed for cybersecurity applications, demonstrating 90% improvement in training stability over traditional adversarial methods, (2) comprehensive empirical analysis of deception effectiveness across 8 distinct defensive strategies with quantified performance metrics, representing the most systematic evaluation of blue agent strategies to date, (3) systematic cross-evaluation analysis of RL agent interactions through a 40-combination experimental matrix, and (4) validated scalability characterization from small-scale to enterprise-level network deployments up to 10,000 hosts.

The experimental validation across multiple network scales, agent configurations, and training methodologies establishes a robust foundation for practical cybersecurity RL applications. The systematic experimental approach, with multi-seed validation and statistical significance testing, ensures reproducibility and reliability of findings. The established experimental framework and validated methodologies provide a solid foundation for future research in adversarial cybersecurity learning.

Our findings advance the field through both theoretical insights into multi-agent training dynamics and practical guidelines for defensive strategy selection. The validated training methodologies, comprehensive performance characterization, and reproducible experimental framework enable future researchers to build upon our work and extend it to novel cybersecurity challenges.

This research represents a significant advancement in experimental validation of cybersecurity AI systems, with immediate applicability to both research communities and practical defensive system development. The established methodologies and validated approaches provide a foundation for addressing the growing challenges of autonomous cyber defense in an increasingly complex threat landscape.
