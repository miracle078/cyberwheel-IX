## 1. Document Foundation and Structure

### 1.1 LaTeX Document Architecture

**Document Class and Configuration**:
```latex
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
```

**Theoretical Foundation**: The choice of `article` class indicates this is a journal-style research paper rather than a book or conference proceedings. The 11pt font size provides optimal readability for technical content with mathematical notation.

**Package Dependencies Analysis**:
- **enumitem**: Enhanced list control for structured presentation
- **floatrow**: Advanced figure/table positioning algorithms
- **tikz**: Programmatic vector graphics for network diagrams
- **hyperref**: PDF cross-referencing and navigation
- **amsmath/amssymb**: Advanced mathematical typesetting
- **natbib**: Citation management with numerical and author-year styles

### 1.2 Mathematical Notation Framework

**Custom Command Definitions**:
```latex
\newcommand{\R}{\bs{\MC{R}}}           % Reward function
\newcommand{\Rhat}{\bs{\hat{\MC{R}}}}  % Estimated reward
\newcommand{\Dtrain}{\MC{D}^{\TN{offline}}}  % Training dataset
\newcommand{\Deval}{\MC{D}^{\TN{eval}}}      % Evaluation dataset
```

**Theoretical Significance**: These commands establish a consistent mathematical vocabulary throughout the document. The distinction between `\R` and `\Rhat` reflects the fundamental ML concept of true vs. estimated functions. The dataset notation `\Dtrain` and `\Deval` enforces the critical train/test split principle.

### 1.3 Collaborative Research Infrastructure

**Multi-Author Comment System**:
```latex
\newcommand{\kwz}[1]{{\color{violet} [{#1}]}}  % Author KWZ
\newcommand{\hn}[1]{{\color{red} [HN: {#1}]}}  % Author HN
\newcommand{\dan}[1]{{\color{green} [Dan: {#1}]}} % Author Dan
```

**Methodological Implication**: This color-coded comment system indicates rigorous collaborative review processes, essential for maintaining scientific accuracy in complex technical work.

### 3.2 Theoretical Foundation Analysis

**Game Theory Foundations**:
```
Security Games: Defender resource allocation against strategic adversaries
