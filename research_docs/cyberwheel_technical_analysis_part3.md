## 7. Evaluation Methodology

### 7.1 Primary Security Metrics Framework

**Deception Effectiveness Mathematical Definition**:
```
Deception Rate = Σ_{t,h} 𝟙[red attacks decoy at (t,h)] / Σ_{t,h} 𝟙[red attacks any host at (t,h)]

Interpretation:
- Numerator: Count of attacks against honeypots/decoys
- Denominator: Total attack attempts
- Range: [0,1] where 1 = perfect deception, 0 = no deception success
```

**Asset Protection Rate**:
```
Protection Rate = (|H_real| - |{h ∈ H_real : compromised(h)}|) / |H_real|

Where:
H_real = set of non-decoy hosts in network
compromised(h) = boolean function indicating host compromise status
```

**Attack Detection Latency**:
```
Detection Latency = 𝔼[min_h {h : alert generated at timestep h} - attack_start]

Statistical Properties:
- Lower values indicate faster detection
- Variance indicates detection consistency
- Critical for incident response timing analysis
```

### 7.2 Operational Efficiency Metrics

**Resource Efficiency**:
```
Resource Efficiency = Successful_Deceptions / (|Active_Decoys| + c·|Isolation_Actions|)

Parameters:
c = cost coefficient for isolation actions (typically c = 2-5)
Measures deception ROI relative to resource investment
```

**False Positive Rate**:
```
False Positive Rate = Σ_{t,h} 𝟙[false alert at (t,h)] / Σ_{t,h} 𝟙[any alert at (t,h)]

Critical for operational viability:
- High FPR leads to alert fatigue
- Low FPR may indicate detection gaps
- Optimal range: 0.05-0.15 for practical systems
```

### 7.3 Strategic Learning Metrics

**Total Expected Reward Formulation**:
```
J^(b) = 𝔼[Σ_{t=1}^T Σ_{h=1}^H γ^{h-1} R_{t,h}^(b)]     (Blue Agent Objective)
J^(r) = 𝔼[Σ_{t=1}^T Σ_{h=1}^H γ^{h-1} R_{t,h}^(r)]     (Red Agent Objective)

Where:
T = number of episodes
H = episode horizon
γ = discount factor (0.95)
R_{t,h}^(·) = reward at episode t, timestep h
```

**Strategic Adaptation Index**:
```
Adaptation Index = Performance_{final_10%} / Performance_{first_10%}

Measures learning progression:
- > 1: Performance improvement over training
- < 1: Performance degradation (concerning)
- ≈ 1: Stable performance (may indicate convergence or stagnation)
```

**Mean Time to Compromise (MTTC)**:
```
MTTC = 𝔼[min_h {h : critical asset compromised at timestep h}]

Enterprise Relevance:
- Measures defensive effectiveness against targeted attacks
- Directly correlates with business impact assessment
- Critical metric for security investment decisions
```

### 7.4 Network-Specific Metrics

**Coverage Quality**:
```
Coverage Quality = Σ_{s∈S} w_s · (decoys_in_subnet_s / total_hosts_in_subnet_s)

Where:
w_s = subnet importance weight based on asset criticality
S = set of network subnets
Measures strategic value of defensive deployments
```

**Attack Surface Reduction**:
```
Surface Reduction = 1 - (|accessible_vulnerable_hosts| / |total_vulnerable_hosts|)

Implementation:
- accessible = reachable through current network state
- vulnerable = hosts with exploitable vulnerabilities
- Measures effectiveness of network segmentation and isolation
```

```

### 8.4 Phase 3: Red Agent Mastery - Attack Strategy Diversification

**Five Red Agent Strategy Mathematical Models**:

}
```

```

### 8.5 Phase 4: Cross-Evaluation Matrix - Systematic Agent Interaction Analysis

```
