# Cyberwheel Training Fixes - Integration Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start Implementation

### Step 1: Backup Current System
```bash
# Create backup of current training results
cp -r cyberwheel/data/ cyberwheel/data_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/

# Backup current agent implementations  
cp -r cyberwheel/agents/ cyberwheel/agents_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

### Step 2: Apply Critical Fixes (Priority Order)

#### Fix 1: Decoy Limit Checking (IMMEDIATE)
**Problem**: 94% decoy deployment failures causing massive negative rewards

**Implementation Location**: `cyberwheel/agents/blue_agent.py`
```python
# Add to blue agent __init__
self.decoy_manager = DecoyManager(max_decoys_per_subnet=5)

# Modify action selection
def select_action(self, observation):
    if self.intended_action == 'deploy_decoy':
        target_subnet = self.select_target_subnet(observation)
        if not self.decoy_manager.can_deploy_decoy(target_subnet):
            # Choose alternative action instead of failing
            return self.select_alternative_action(observation)
    return self.intended_action, target
```

#### Fix 2: Reduce Red Agent Success Rates (IMMEDIATE)
**Problem**: 100% success prevents blue agent learning

**Implementation Location**: `cyberwheel/agents/red_agent.py`
```python
# Modify action execution
def execute_action(self, action_type, target, blue_defenses):
    base_rates = {
        'pingsweep': 0.85,
        'portscan': 0.75, 
        'lateral-movement': 0.65,
        'discovery': 0.80
    }
    
    success_rate = base_rates.get(action_type, 0.7)
    
    # Reduce success if blue has defenses
    if blue_defenses.get('decoys_nearby', 0) > 0:
        success_rate -= 0.1
    if blue_defenses.get('host_isolated', False):
        success_rate -= 0.2
        
    return random.random() < success_rate
```

#### Fix 3: Enhanced Reward Function (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Negative reward dominance prevents learning

**Implementation Location**: `cyberwheel/environment/reward_system.py`
```python
def calculate_blue_reward(self, action, success, game_state):
    if action == 'deploy_decoy':
        if success:
            return +20  # Increased from negative values
        else:
            return -5   # Reduced penalty for failures
    
    elif action == 'isolate_host' and success:
        return +35      # Strong positive for effective defense
    
    # Add episode completion bonuses
    if game_state.get('threats_contained'):
        return +100     # Major bonus for containment
```

### Step 3: Testing Protocol

#### Phase 1: Unit Testing (Day 1)
```bash
# Test decoy limit checking
python test_decoy_limits.py

# Test red agent rebalancing  
python test_red_success_rates.py

# Test reward calculation
python test_enhanced_rewards.py
```

#### Phase 2: Integration Testing (Day 2-3)
```bash
# Run short training episodes with fixes
python train_with_fixes.py --episodes 10 --debug

# Compare results with baseline
python compare_training_results.py
```

#### Phase 3: Full Training Test (Day 4-5)
```bash
# Run complete training with all fixes
python train_cyberwheel.py --config enhanced_config.yaml --episodes 100
```

### Step 4: Expected Improvements

#### Immediate (After Fix 1)
- Decoy deployment failure rate: 94% â†’ <20%
- Blue agent step rewards: -5.46 â†’ positive
- Episode length: More varied (not fixed 100 steps)

#### Short-term (After Fix 2-3)
- Red agent success rate: 100% â†’ 70-80%
- Blue agent learning: Visible improvement trends
- Strategy diversity: >40% non-decoy actions

#### Medium-term (Full Implementation)
- Balanced competition between agents
- Positive episode rewards for blue agent
- Transferable strategies across scenarios

### Step 5: Monitoring and Adjustment

#### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Decoy Management**:
   - Deployment success rate (target: >80%)
   - Limit violations per episode (target: <2)

2. **Agent Balance**:
   - Red success rate (target: 70-80%)
   - Blue learning trend (target: positive slope)

3. **Training Quality**:
   - Episode reward variance (target: decreasing)
   - Action diversity (target: >60%)

#### Adjustment Protocol
```python
# Monitor training every 10 episodes
if blue_success_rate < 0.2:
    reduce_red_capabilities(0.9)  # 10% reduction
elif blue_success_rate > 0.8:
    increase_red_capabilities(1.1)  # 10% increase

# Adjust decoy limits based on network size
if network_size > 50:
    max_decoys_per_subnet = 8
elif network_size < 20:
    max_decoys_per_subnet = 3
```
