# Cyberwheel Framework: Comprehensive Technical Analysis & Mathematical Foundations

## üéØ Executive Summary

Cyberwheel is a state-of-the-art, high-fidelity simulation environment developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for training autonomous cyber defense agents using reinforcement learning. This framework represents a significant advancement in cybersecurity AI research, combining rigorous mathematical foundations with practical implementation to address critical limitations in existing training platforms.

### Mathematical Foundation Overview
The framework is built on graph-theoretic network representation, Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation, and sophisticated observation spaces that enable effective learning of cyber defense strategies. Key mathematical components include:

- **Network Representation**: G = (V, E) where V = H ‚à™ S ‚à™ R (hosts, subnets, routers) using nx.DiGraph
- **Agent States**: RedState_t = ‚ü®position_t, knowledge_t, killchain_t‚ü©, BlueState_t = ‚ü®D_t, A_t, budget_t‚ü©  
- **Observation Space**: O_t ‚àà R^n with dual structure [current_alerts, history_alerts, metadata]
- **Reward Function**: R_t = R_deception + R_protection + R_cost with 10√ó deception multiplier
- **Learning Objective**: œÄ* = argmax_œÄ E[‚àëŒ≥^t R_t | œÄ] using PPO optimization with clipping

### Key Research Context
Based on the paper *"Towards a High Fidelity Training Environment for Autonomous Cyber Defense Agents"*, Cyberwheel was developed to overcome fundamental shortcomings in existing environments such as:
- Poor documentation and outdated implementations
- Limited scalability and extensibility  
- Lack of high-fidelity simulation-to-reality transfer
- Insufficient visualization and explainability tools
- Limited support for diverse network topologies and agent strategies
- Unrealistic observation spaces and detection assumptions

## üî¨ Mathematical Foundations & Theory

### Network Representation (Graph-Theoretic Foundation)
Cyberwheel represents networks using directed graphs with mathematical rigor:

```
G = (V, E)
V = H ‚à™ S ‚à™ R  
E ‚äÜ V √ó V
```

Where:
- **H** = set of hosts (computers/devices)  
- **S** = set of subnets (network segments)
- **R** = set of routers (network infrastructure)
- **E** = set of directed edges representing network connections

### Host Modeling Mathematics
Each host h_i ‚àà H is characterized by a comprehensive state vector:

```
h_i = ‚ü®IP_i, OS_i, S_i, V_i, compromised_i, decoy_i‚ü©
```

Where:
- **IP_i** = IP address assignment
- **OS_i** = operating system type  
- **S_i** = set of running services
- **V_i** = set of vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- **compromised_i ‚àà {0,1}** = compromise status
- **decoy_i ‚àà {0,1}** = whether host is a honeypot

### Complete Network State Formulation
The complete network state at time t is mathematically defined as:

```
N_t = ‚ü®G, {h_i}_{i=1}^{|H|}, {s_j}_{j=1}^{|S|}, {r_k}_{k=1}^{|R|}‚ü©
```

This enables precise reasoning about network topology, host relationships, and security states.

## üèóÔ∏è Overall Architecture & Big Picture

Cyberwheel implements a mathematically rigorous multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where:
- **Red Agents** (attackers) follow MITRE ATT&CK killchain phases with state RedState_t = ‚ü®position_t, knowledge_t, killchain_t‚ü©
- **Blue Agents** (defenders) deploy cyber deception and isolation strategies with state BlueState_t = ‚ü®D_t, A_t, budget_t‚ü©  
- **Environment** provides realistic network simulation as MDP = ‚ü®S, A, P, R, Œ≥‚ü©
- **Detection System** processes alerts with probabilistic detection modeling
- **Reward System** incentivizes effective defensive strategies through deception-based rewards

### Agent Framework Mathematics

#### Red Agent (Attacker) Mathematical Model
The red agent represents a cyber attacker following MITRE ATT&CK with precise state definition:

```
RedState_t = ‚ü®position_t, knowledge_t, killchain_t‚ü©
```

Where:
- **position_t ‚àà H** = current compromised host
- **knowledge_t ‚äÜ H √ó S** = discovered network information  
- **killchain_t ‚àà {discovery, reconnaissance, privilege-escalation, impact}**

#### Blue Agent (Defender) Mathematical Model  
The blue agent represents the cyber defender with state:

```
BlueState_t = ‚ü®D_t, A_t, budget_t‚ü©
```

Where:
- **D_t** = set of deployed decoys
- **A_t** = alert history
- **budget_t ‚àà R^+** = available resources

### Core Design Principles
1. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new defensive/offensive actions without architectural changes
2. **Scalability**: Support for networks from 15 hosts to 1+ million hosts
3. **High Fidelity**: Realistic network components, services, and attack patterns
4. **Modularity**: YAML-driven configuration for all components
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive visualization and logging for model analysis

### Mathematical Foundations

The framework's mathematical foundation starts with the Markov Decision Process definition:

**MDP Definition**: M = ‚ü®S, A, P, R, Œ≥‚ü©
- **S**: State space combining network topology and agent states
- **A**: Action space (A_red ‚à™ A_blue for multi-agent environment)
- **P**: Transition probability function P(s'|s,a)
- **R**: Reward function mapping state-action pairs to real values
- **Œ≥ ‚àà [0,1)**: Discount factor for future rewards

**Network Representation**: The cyber environment is modeled as a directed graph:
```
G_network = (H ‚à™ S, E_network)  # Implemented as nx.DiGraph
```
Where:
- **H** = {h‚ÇÅ, h‚ÇÇ, ..., h‚Çô} is the set of hosts
- **S** = {s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, ..., s‚Çò} is the set of services  
- **E_network** ‚äÜ (H ‚à™ S) √ó (H ‚à™ S) represents network connections

**Host Modeling**: Each host h ‚àà H is characterized by:
```
h = ‚ü®IP_h, services_h, vulnerabilities_h, privileges_h, is_compromised_h, decoy_h‚ü©
```

**Network State**: The complete network state at time t is:
```
NetworkState_t = ‚ü®G_network, {HostState_h,t}_{h‚ààH}, {ServiceState_s,t}_{s‚ààS}‚ü©
```
