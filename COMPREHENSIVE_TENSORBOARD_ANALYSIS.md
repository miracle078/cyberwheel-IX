## Detailed Experiment Analysis

### 1. Phase1_Validation_HPC (Baseline Validation)
- **Network Size:** 15 hosts with decoy configuration
- **Total Runs:** 2 runs analyzed
- **Training Duration:** 1,000 steps each

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Run 0:**
  - Final Return: -97.00
  - Max Return: 180.50
  - Average Time to Impact: 25.9 steps
  - Average Steps Delayed: 2.95 steps

- **Run 1:**
  - Final Return: 722.00 
  - Max Return: 722.00
  - Average Time to Impact: 27.2 steps
  - Average Steps Delayed: 3.15 steps

#### Analysis:
The validation phase shows high variability between runs, with Run 1 significantly outperforming Run 0. This suggests the baseline configuration is sensitive to initialization and requires longer training for consistent performance.

### 2. Phase2_Blue_HighDecoy_HPC (High Decoy Configuration)
- **Network Size:** 200 hosts with high decoy density
- **Training Duration:** 5,000,000 steps
- **Data Points:** 6,250 recorded measurements

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Final Return:** -246.75
- **Max Return:** -192.44 (consistently negative)
- **Training Steps:** 5,000,000
- **Average Time to Impact:** 0.0 steps (immediate impact)
- **Average Steps Delayed:** 0.5 steps (minimal delay)

#### Analysis:
Despite extensive training, the high decoy configuration failed to achieve positive returns. The immediate time to impact (0.0 steps) indicates that the agent could not effectively prevent attacks, suggesting potential configuration issues or overly challenging attack scenarios.

### 3. Phase2_Blue_Medium_HPC (Medium Configuration - Most Extensive)
- **Network Size:** 200 hosts with medium decoy density
- **Training Duration:** 10,000,000 steps (longest training)
- **Data Points:** 10,000 recorded measurements

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Final Return:** -259.31
- **Max Return:** -185.44 (best observed during training)
- **Min Return:** -346.63
- **Mean Return:** -251.71
- **Average Time to Impact:** 0.84 steps
- **Average Steps Delayed:** 0.4 steps

#### Analysis:
The most extensively trained experiment still achieved negative returns, but showed some improvement over the high decoy configuration. The small positive time to impact (0.84 steps) suggests minimal defensive effectiveness, indicating the need for hyperparameter tuning or architectural improvements.

### 4. Phase2_Blue_Small_HPC (Small Network - Best Performance)
- **Network Size:** 15 hosts 
- **Training Duration:** 1,000,000 steps
- **Data Points:** 2,500 recorded measurements

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Final Return:** -80.25
- **Max Return:** 752.38 (highest across all experiments)
- **Average Time to Impact:** 26.42 steps (excellent defensive performance)
- **Average Steps Delayed:** 5.25 steps (best delay achieved)

#### Analysis:
The small network configuration achieved the best overall performance with the highest maximum return (752.38) and excellent defensive metrics. The 26.42 steps average time to impact demonstrates effective defensive strategies, making this the most promising configuration.

### 5. Phase2_Blue_PerfectDetection_HPC (Perfect Detection Scenario)
- **Network Size:** 15 hosts with perfect detection
- **Training Duration:** 5,000,000 steps
- **Data Points:** 6,250 recorded measurements

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Final Return:** 255.88 (only positive final return)
- **Max Return:** 714.38
- **Average Time to Impact:** 25.79 steps
- **Average Steps Delayed:** 5.92 steps (highest delay)

#### Analysis:
This experiment achieved the only positive final return (255.88) and maintained consistent performance throughout training. The perfect detection scenario demonstrates the potential of the system when detection capabilities are optimized.

## Recommendations Based on Analysis

### 1. Configuration Optimization
- **Small Network (15 hosts)** configurations show superior performance and should be prioritized
- **Perfect Detection** scenarios provide the clearest success path
- **High Decoy** configurations require fundamental architectural review

### 2. Training Duration
- Longer training (10M steps) did not correlate with better performance
- Medium-length training (1M steps) appears optimal for the small network configuration

### 3. Architecture Improvements
- Value loss instability in validation runs indicates need for better value function approximation
- Policy loss convergence suggests the policy architecture is functioning correctly
- Learning rate schedules appear appropriate across configurations

### 4. Future Experiments
- Focus on small-to-medium network sizes (15-50 hosts)
- Investigate intermediate detection quality levels
- Implement adaptive decoy placement strategies
