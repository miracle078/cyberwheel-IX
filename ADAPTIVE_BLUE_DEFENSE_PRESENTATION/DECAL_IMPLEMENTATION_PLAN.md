            {
                'name': 'Basic Network Defense',
                'network_size': 5, 
                'attack_types': 1,
                'episode_length': 100,
                'red_agent_skill': 0.3
            },

            }
        ]
        self.current_level = 0
        self.performance_history = []
    
    def should_advance(self, success_rate, episodes_at_level):
        """Simple threshold-based advancement"""
        min_episodes = 1000  # Minimum episodes per level
        success_threshold = 0.7  # 70% success rate to advance
        
        return (episodes_at_level >= min_episodes and 
                success_rate > success_threshold and 
                self.current_level < len(self.levels) - 1)
    
    def get_current_config(self):
        """Return current level configuration"""
        return self.levels[self.current_level]
    
    def advance_level(self):
        """Move to next curriculum level"""
        if self.current_level < len(self.levels) - 1:
            self.current_level += 1
            print(f"Advanced to Level {self.current_level + 1}: {self.levels[self.current_level]['name']}")

### **Advanced Components:**

**Curriculum Policy Network:**
```python
class CurriculumPolicy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, hidden_dim=128):
        super().__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, action_dim),
            nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
        )
    
    def forward(self, curriculum_state):
        """Select next curriculum task based on learning progress"""
        return self.network(curriculum_state)
```

**Curriculum State Representation:**
- Current agent success rate
- Learning velocity (performance improvement rate)
- Policy entropy (exploration level)
- Episode efficiency metrics
- Transfer learning indicators

**Curriculum Reward Function:**
```python
def curriculum_reward(agent_performance, sample_efficiency, transfer_quality):
    """Reward curriculum policy for effective teaching"""
    return (0.4 * agent_performance + 
            0.3 * sample_efficiency + 
            0.3 * transfer_quality)
```
