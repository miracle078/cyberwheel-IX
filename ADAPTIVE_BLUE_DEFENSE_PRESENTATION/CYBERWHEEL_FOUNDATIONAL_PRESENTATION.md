## SLIDE 2: WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO
**Layout:** Simple problem-solution layout
**Background:** Clear, uncluttered design

### Content:
**Title:** Problem Overview

**The Core Challenge:**
"How can we train computer programs to automatically defend networks against cyber attacks, where both attackers and defenders are learning and adapting to each other?"

**Real-World Analogy:**
Think of training two security teams:
- **Red Team (Attackers):** Try to break into a building using various methods
- **Blue Team (Defenders):** Try to detect and stop break-ins using cameras, alarms, and decoy rooms

**Key Insight:** Both teams get better over time by learning from successes and failures

**Why This Matters:**
- Human analysts are too slow for modern attacks
- Attackers adapt faster than traditional security systems
- We need AI that can keep up with evolving threats

**Speaker Notes:** (2 minutes)
"Let me start with the fundamental question we're trying to answer. Imagine you're running security for a building, and you need to train two teams simultaneously - attackers who try to break in, and defenders who try to stop them. Both teams learn from each encounter. That's exactly what we're doing, but for computer networks."

## SLIDE 3: LEARNING STRATEGIES THROUGH EXPERIENCE
**Layout:** Step-by-step learning process
**Background:** Educational, clear design

### Content:
**Title:** HOW CYBER AGENTS LEARN BY TRIAL AND ERROR

**Reinforcement Learning Basics:**
1. **Try different actions** in an environment
2. **Get feedback** (rewards or penalties) for actions
3. **Learn which actions** lead to better outcomes over time

**Simple Example - Teaching AI to Play Pac-Man:**
- **Environment:** The maze
- **Actions:** Move up, down, left, right
- **Rewards:** +10 for dots, +50 for ghosts, -100 for getting caught
- **Learning:** Over many games, discovers winning strategies

**The Mathematics (Optional Detail):**
- **Goal:** Find strategy π that maximizes total reward
- **Formula:** J(π) = Expected sum of all future rewards
- **Key:** Balance immediate rewards vs. long-term success

**Why This Works:** Same way humans and animals learn - through experience and feedback

**Speaker Notes:** (3 minutes)
"Reinforcement learning is just a fancy way of saying 'learning through trial and error.' It's exactly how you learned to ride a bike - try something, see what happens, adjust, repeat. The computer tries different actions, gets feedback on how well they worked, and gradually discovers better strategies."

## SLIDE 4: MAKING IT "ADVERSARIAL"
**Layout:** Two-player game visualization
**Background:** Game-like theme with opposing elements

### Content:
**Title:** Two Players Learning Against Each Other

**What Makes It Adversarial:**
- Two agents learning simultaneously
- One agent's success often means the other's failure
- Creates an "arms race" of improvement

**Chess Analogy:**
- Player 1 gets better at attacking
- Player 2 gets better at defending
- As Player 1 improves, Player 2 must adapt
- As Player 2 improves, Player 1 finds new strategies

**Why This Is Hard:**
- The "environment" keeps changing as opponent learns
- Training can become unstable
- Need to find balance between competing strategies

**Mathematical Challenge:**
Instead of just maximizing your own score, you're trying to maximize your score while your opponent tries to minimize it

**Speaker Notes:** (3 minutes)
"Now imagine both players in our chess game are learning simultaneously. Every time one player gets better, the other has to adapt. This creates an arms race where both players continuously evolve their strategies. This is much harder than normal machine learning because the problem keeps changing as both agents learn."

## SLIDE 5: THE CYBERSECURITY ENVIRONMENT
**Layout:** Network diagram with clear labels
**Background:** Network infrastructure theme

### Content:
**Title:** Our Virtual Cyber Battlefield (Small Office to Large Scalable Networks)

**What Is the "Environment"?**
A simulated computer network with:
- **Multiple computers** (15 to 10,000 in our experiments)
- **Network connections** between computers
- **Vulnerabilities** (security weaknesses) on some computers
- **Decoy computers** (fake systems designed to trap attackers)

**Concrete Example - Small Office Network:**
- 15 computers total
- 3 servers (valuable targets)
- 2 decoy computers (look real but are traps)
- 10 regular workstations
- Organized in subnets (like floors in a building)

**Real-World Connection:**
This mirrors actual enterprise networks that organizations need to protect

**Speaker Notes:** (2 minutes)
"Our environment is a simulated computer network - think of it like a virtual building with computers instead of rooms. Some computers are valuable targets, some are decoys designed to trick attackers, and they're all connected in realistic ways that mirror how actual companies organize their networks."

## SLIDE 6: WHAT CAN OUR AGENTS DO? (ATTACK AND DEFENSE CAPABILITIES)
**Layout:** Side-by-side agent capabilities
**Background:** Action-focused design

### Content:
**Title:** Red vs Blue: 295 Attack Techniques vs Strategic Deception Defense Actions

**Red Agent (Attacker) Actions:**
Real-world cyber attack techniques:
1. **Discovery:** Scan network to find computers
2. **Reconnaissance:** Probe for vulnerabilities
3. **Exploitation:** Break into vulnerable systems
4. **Impact:** Steal data or disrupt services

**Blue Agent (Defender) Actions:**
Real-world defense techniques:
1. **Deploy Decoys:** Place fake computers as traps
2. **Remove Decoys:** Take down ineffective traps
3. **Isolate Hosts:** Disconnect compromised systems
4. **Monitor & Wait:** Sometimes best action is patience

**The Scale:**
- Red agent has 295 real attack techniques (from MITRE ATT&CK framework)
- Blue agent actions scale with network size
- Both agents must choose wisely - resources are limited

**Speaker Notes:** (2 minutes)
"Our red agent can use 295 real-world attack techniques catalogued by cybersecurity experts. The blue agent focuses on strategic defense - not just blocking attacks, but using deception and intelligent monitoring. Both agents must make smart choices because they have limited resources."

## SLIDE 7: THE REWARD SYSTEM (WHAT SUCCESS MEANS)
**Layout:** Reward/penalty visualization
**Background:** Feedback-focused design

### Content:
**Title:** How Agents Learn What's Good and Bad

**Red Agent Rewards:**
- **+Points:** Successful attacks on real computers
- **+Bonus:** Compromising valuable servers
- **-Penalty:** Getting detected by blue agent

**Blue Agent Rewards:**
- **+BIG Points:** Tricking attackers into decoys (10× multiplier!)
- **+Points:** Protecting real computers
- **-Points:** Cost of maintaining too many decoys

**Key Insight - The "10× Rule":**
Deceiving an attacker gives 10 times more reward than simply blocking them. This strongly encourages clever deception strategies.

**Why This Matters:**
The reward system shapes how agents learn. By making deception highly rewarding, we encourage creative defensive strategies.

**Speaker Notes:** (2 minutes)
"The reward system is crucial - it's how we tell the agents what we value. Notice that tricking an attacker into a decoy gives 10 times more reward than simply blocking an attack. This teaches the blue agent that deception is often more valuable than just building walls."

## SLIDE 8: HOW AGENTS ACTUALLY LEARN
**Layout:** Learning process visualization
**Background:** Algorithm explanation theme

### Content:
**Title:** The Learning Algorithm: Proximal Policy Optimization (Making Cautious Improvements)

**Think of PPO as a Cautious Student:**
- Try new strategies, but not too different from what worked
- If new strategy works well → adjust slightly in that direction
- If new strategy fails → adjust away from it
- Never make huge changes (prevents "forgetting" good strategies)

**Why "Proximal" (Close/Nearby)?**
- Makes small, safe improvements rather than big risky changes
- Prevents learning instability
- Maintains what already works while exploring improvements

**The Magic Formula (Simplified):**
"Take the best of: [new approach] vs [cautious version of new approach]"

**Why This Matters:**
PPO is stable and reliable - crucial when training two competing agents

**Speaker Notes:** (2 minutes)
"PPO stands for Proximal Policy Optimization. Think of it as a very cautious student who tries new approaches but never strays too far from what already works. This caution is crucial when training two agents against each other, because we need stable, predictable learning."

## SLIDE 9: SOLVING THE TRAINING INSTABILITY PROBLEM
**Layout:** Innovation highlight with problem/solution
**Background:** Breakthrough/innovation theme

### Content:
**Title:** Uniform Starting Points for Balanced Adversarial Learning

**The Problem with Normal Training:**
- Sometimes one agent learns much faster than the other
- Fast learner dominates, slow learner stops improving
- Training becomes unstable or gets stuck

**SULI Solution (Self-play with Uniform Learning Initialization):**
- **Start both agents identically** - same "blank slate" knowledge
- **Let them learn together gradually**
- **Maintain balance** throughout training
- **Result:** More stable, realistic strategies

**Real-World Analogy:**
Like training two chess players who start with identical knowledge and learn by playing each other, rather than one starting as a beginner and one as an expert.

**Why This Works:**
Creates a balanced "arms race" where both agents evolve together naturally

**Speaker Notes:** (3 minutes)
"SULI is our key contribution. Traditional adversarial training often fails because one agent dominates the other. Our solution? Start both agents with identical 'blank slate' knowledge and let them evolve together. This creates a balanced learning process where both agents develop sophisticated strategies organically."
