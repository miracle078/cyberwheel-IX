### SLIDE 2: Problem Overview - Clear Challenge Setup
**Title to Import:** "Problem Overview"

**Content Structure:**
```
The Core Challenge:
"How can we train computer programs to automatically defend networks against cyber attacks, where both attackers and defenders are learning and adapting to each other?"

Real-World Analogy:
• Red Team (Attackers): Try to break into building
• Blue Team (Defenders): Detect and stop break-ins
• Key Insight: Both teams improve through learning

Why This Matters:
• Human analysts too slow for modern attacks
• Attackers adapt faster than traditional systems
• Need AI that keeps up with evolving threats
```

### SLIDE 3: Reinforcement Learning Foundations
**Title to Import:** "HOW CYBER AGENTS LEARN BY TRIAL AND ERROR"

**Content Focus:**
```
Reinforcement Learning Basics:
1. Try different actions in environment
2. Get feedback (rewards/penalties)
3. Learn which actions lead to better outcomes

Pac-Man Example:
• Environment: The maze
• Actions: Move directions
• Rewards: +10 dots, +50 ghosts, -100 caught
• Learning: Discovers winning strategies

Mathematics (Optional):
• Goal: Find strategy π maximizing total reward
• Formula: J(π) = Expected sum future rewards
• Key: Balance immediate vs long-term success
```

**Canva Elements:**
- Search "Pac-Man maze, learning process diagram"

```
What Makes It Adversarial:
• Two agents learning simultaneously
• One's success = other's challenge
• Creates improvement "arms race"

Chess Analogy:
• Player 1 improves attacking
• Player 2 improves defending  
• Continuous adaptation cycle
• Evolving strategies

Why Hard:
• Environment changes as opponent learns
• Training can become unstable
• Need balance between competing strategies
```

**Canva Elements:**
- Search "chess game, competitive learning"
- Two-player game visualization
- Arms race concept illustration

### SLIDE 5: Network Environment
**Title to Import:** "Our Virtual Cyber Battlefield (Small Office to Large Scalable Networks)"

**Content Focus:**
```
Simulated Network Environment:

Small Office Example:
• 15 computers total
• 3 servers (valuable targets)
• 2 decoys (look real, are traps)
• 10 regular workstations
• Organized in subnets (like building floors)
```

**Canva Elements:**

2. Reconnaissance: Probe vulnerabilities
3. Exploitation: Break into systems
4. Impact: Steal data/disrupt services

Blue Agent (Defender) Actions:
1. Deploy Decoys: Place fake computer traps
2. Remove Decoys: Take down ineffective traps
3. Isolate Hosts: Disconnect compromised systems
4. Monitor & Wait: Strategic patience

Scale:
• 295 real MITRE ATT&CK techniques
• Actions scale with network size
• Limited resources require smart choices
```

• -Penalty: Getting detected

Blue Agent Rewards:
• +BIG Points: Tricking attackers into decoys (10× multiplier!)
• +Points: Protecting real computers
• -Points: Cost of maintaining decoys

10× Rule Insight:
Deception gives 10× more reward than blocking
→ Encourages clever defensive strategies
```

**Canva Elements:**

```
Think of PPO as Cautious Student:
• Try new strategies, not too different from what worked
• If new works well → adjust slightly toward it
• If new fails → adjust away from it
• Never make huge changes (prevents forgetting)

Why "Proximal" (Nearby):
• Small, safe improvements vs big risky changes
• Prevents learning instability
• Maintains what works while exploring

Magic Formula (Simplified):
"Take best of: [new approach] vs [cautious version]"
```

• Fast learner dominates, slow stops improving
• Training becomes unstable

SULI Solution:
• Start both agents identically (blank slate)
• Let them learn together gradually
• Maintain balance throughout training
• Result: Stable, realistic strategies

Chess Analogy:
Two players starting with identical knowledge,
learning by playing each other
(vs beginner vs expert starting point)
